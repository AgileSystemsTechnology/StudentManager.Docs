# **Academic Comments**

## **Per Student / Individual Comments**

There are two methods of adding academic comments. One is on the module group itself and the other is within the Module on Student Coursework Page.  The comment is then displayed on the Results Notification Report with the module.

### **Academic Comments from the Coursework Page**

- Show the Modules under the Qualification
- In line with the module, click on **Edit**
- A new window will display, the last field displays: **Academic Record Comment** 
- Click on **Save** to save the comment

### **Academic Comments from the Module**

- Navigate to the **Group** within the **Module** 
- Click on the **Students** tab
- Select the correct group
- In line with the student name, click on **Edit Comment**
- A new window will display, the last field displays: **Academic Record Comment** 
- Click on **Save** to save the comment

## **Per Semester / Term Comments**

The other method is to add a comment for a period (e.g. a term or semester) related to their overall conduct or progress for example. These also show on the Results Notification Report. 

Comments are displayed per First Level grouping (e.g. Year 1) on the report. But what displays is dependant on the Minimum and Maximum start dates for the module groups within the groupings and the effective period selected for the comment.

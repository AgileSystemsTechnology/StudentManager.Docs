## **Setup for Profile Details Update Request**

These are the settings which should be in place prior to using the details update feature

### **System setup to use this feature effectively**
- Ensure that in Communication Settings, there is a "mailbox" with the description "General", updates will use this mailbox by default (further configuration options will become available in future updates)
- If a "General" mailbox is not available, this feature will fail and display and error on attempting an update request
- To Navigate to the communication settings, Select More, Settings, Communication (Use this [**_tutorial link_**](https://www.iorad.com/player/116489/Checking-if-there-is-a--General--mailbox) to assist if you are unfamiliar with where it is)
- Once this has been verified, you are ready to send detail update requests
- **_Please note that staff notifications for details update requests are scheduled for a later release_**

## **A Single User with two Roles**

Student Manager allows for a staff member to have a student role and vice versa.  To set this up, follow these steps:

The way student manager approached users is to set up a person’s profile once (this contains all the personal data etc) and then assign “accounts” to them. The key value is the **email address**, so if someone tries to capture a staff member or student and the email already exists in the system it will pick it up as the same person.

### **To add a staff account to a student:**

- Navigate to the **Student Profile** page
- First check **email address** for student 
- Then go back to the **People** page, click on **Add Staff**
- Fill in the staff **first name, last name and email.** 
  - _Note: Don’t worry with any of the other details because they will come from the student information._
- When you click on **save**, it will display a message saying the email address already exists and request if you want to use the person with the same email address. Please click **Yes**, this will then create a staff account linked to the student.

### **To navigate between accounts:**

- For a user to interact with student manager under the two different accounts (Staff & Student) the user must use the **Switch Account** button at the top right of the screen.
- The student will be presented with a screen to chose which account he wants to work in.  (Employee or Student)
  - Select **Switch** to toggle between accounts
  - _Note:  when the user is in student mode, the user will see less information than in the employee mode_

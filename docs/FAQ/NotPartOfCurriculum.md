## **Why does it show "Not Part of Curriculum" on the student coursework?**

**and**

## **The credits is not displaying on the student coursework page?**

The reason is because the module is not added under the curriculum.  To add the modules to the curriculum we first need to take note of a few things:

1. What is the Qualification the student is following?
2. What year does his intake fall under?  (Is it 2015, 2016, etc)
3. Under which level grouping does the "Not part of curriculum" display.  (Is it under 2015 - Year 2 - Semester 1 for example?)

Now that we have that information, we can rectify the problem.

  - Navigate to **Qualification** on the main menu
  - Click on **View** in line with the correct qualification
  - Clik on **Curriculum**
  - (remember you took note of the intake year) Expand the **+** next to the intake year
  - (remember you took note of hte level grouping) Navigate to the correct level grouping (Example, Year 2 - Semester 1)
  - We now need to click on **Add** to add the module that showed "Not part of curriculum"
  - Select the correct module from the drop down list
  - Enter the Credits, Cots, Corequisites and Pre-requisites (if any)
  - Click on **Save**
  
Refresh the student coursework page, it will now be displayed under the correct level grouping with the relevant credits.

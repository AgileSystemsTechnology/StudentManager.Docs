## **Names and labels in Student Manager(SM)**

### **What is the significance of naming or labelling**
- Naming is required for identification and differentiation 
	- This means that a name or label will give guidance to yourself or anyone at your institution, remember when naming that you may not be the last or only person to use the system so using simple naming conventions makes it easier to keep track and spot errors, having a discernable pattern will make it easier to understand, this will be explained later
	- If labelling or naming is a means of identification, we can only identify things in the system if there are distinct differences, for example, a Module called "World History 1" with the code "WH1" is quite similar to a module called "World History I" with the code "WH 1". If you were to ask someone to enrol/register students into the World History One course with the code WH1, they would find it difficult to distinguish between the two, which can have a ripple effect, leading to time loss and frustration

### **Labelling and Character spaces**
- When creating labels it's helpful to remember that a space is a character
- To serve as an example, if I was sending a message using a short message service (SMS) aka text message a space would use up a character on our character count for the message
	- as a further illustration the space will be represented by an underscore "_"
		- Student_Manager has 15 Characters, but only 14 letters
		- If a student's first name is George and I capture it as _George visually they look the same but the system recognises the space as its own character, making George and _George two different names
- Please bear this in mind when generating reports, capturing users or importing students, staff, modules, groups and qualifications, that a space in a name or label can change the way the system identifies results

### **Qualification Names**
- There are two names for qualifications, a Name and a Name of Reports
- The reason is that the one is for the internal use and reference and the other sharing outside the institution
	- So a Name would be something like "The History of The Earth"
	- A Name on Reports could be "The History of The Earth (NQF 5 - 120 credits)"

### **Curriculum Names**
- When naming a curriculum, the logic here is that a curriculum name can be related to:
	- Specilisation e.g. "History of Asia"
	- Year e.g. 2012
	- Period e.g. New Curriculum 2015, old curriculum 2012-2014
	- Intake year e.g. 2012 (Main Campus)
- All of these achieve the same result, as long as all those who need to understand it at your institution can follow the same pattern
		

### **Intake Names**
- When creating an intake name, please consider if these will be seen externally through the applications page or internally
	- Internally "2013" may be fine, but externally if there are multiple intakes in a year you may have "July 2013", "December" 2013", then the applicant will know which intake they are applying for

### **Application Wizard Step Names**
- When giving a name to each step, think of what the applicant will focus on for that particular step, whether its payment detail, personal details, contact details, required documents etc. name it so that they know what they need to focus on for that step

### **Module Names**
- Like qualifications, module name have the same convention as qualifications, the difference is that you may only have a few qualifications, but have hundreds of modules
- Module naming implications:
	- Renamining a module which is in use
		- When renaming an existing module which is linked to students coursework, the module name will change in their coursework, but the name on reports, if not edited, will remain the same
	- Adding a new module with the same name or similar code to the old one
		- Please careful when doing this, as described earlier, the goal is to limit confusion and frustration when labelling so that staff are easily able to pick up where you left off

### **Group Names**
- **TIP** when naming a group, consider using a year reference, e.g. Group name "Wed2013", group code "W13"
	- When using the group copy feature this can be changed to reflect the following year, e.g. "Wed2014", "W14"

### **Assessment Names**
- If these names are standardised for a given module, e.g. Test 1, Test 2, Assignment 1, Assignment 2, Exam, it makes it easier to copy them from year to year


### **Assessment Attempt Names**
- By default an Assessment Attempt name will be something like Attempt 1, this can be renamed if required for internal reference to also help understand the flow of assessment attempts for a given assessment
	- e.g. Attempt 1 could be given the name "Exam", Attempt 2 could have the name "Supplementary" and Attempt 3 could be named "Special Exam"
- This makes it clear to whoever is reading it, what each attempt may refer to, related to your internal policy or procedures

## **Noticeboard**

Much like the old noticeboard where you pin a notice onto a board, the Noticeboard works exactly the same.  Notices can be posted to only staff, only students or both.
Follow these steps to create a new post:

  - Click on **Manage Posts**
    - Here you can change your notice to a Draft for later publishing
  - Click on **Add Notice**
    - Add a **Title** or heading for your post
    - Choose whether you would want to publish this post to staff and students or either or by ticking or unticking the boxes
  in the area below.
    - Enter the description or information.  You can make use of the Styles, Formats, etc. to make your post more appealing.
    - At the bottom of the section you can add a file or a link.  
  
  - To add a file:
    - Click on **Add Files**
    - Click on **Select Files** and browse your computer for the file to be uploaded
    - Click on **Save**, the file will now be uploaded
   
  - To add a link:
    - Click on **Add Links**
    - Enter the URL you have copied into the **URL** section
    - Next to **Title** you can give your URL a name
    - Click on **Save**, the url are now being uploaded
    
_*Note: You can use the **{1}** to display the attached files on the body of your notice.  Each number represents the attachments in numerical order._

  - Click **Save** to save your notice
  Here you can choose to either **publish the post or not**.  If you choose not to publish straight away, your post will be saved into **Draft Notices**.

## **Reversing Module Registrations**

Reversing a module will completely remove the module from all reports and from the student's coursework page.  A trail or history will be kept after the changes is saved. 

First, take note of the module or modules you want to 'remove' and when the registration for this module(s) was, for example:  the start and end date of the registration

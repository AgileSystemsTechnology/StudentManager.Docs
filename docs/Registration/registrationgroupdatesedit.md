## **Editing the Registration Group Dates**

Editing the registration group dates is useful in the following use cases:

1. Registering a student for a module in the past, e.g. if the year is 2019 and groups which existed which they need to be in is in 2018, the group date can be changed to include group dates for that year

2. Registering students for restricted  groups in the year, e.g. in the year there may be two groups, one running for the first half of the year, the other running for the second half, the registration group dates can be confined to either of those so that only those dates are displayed

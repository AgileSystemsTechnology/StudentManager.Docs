## **Adding an application wizard**

A wizard is a feature in a package that guides you through a complicated task. A popular use of wizards in general purpose packages is to take you, step by step, through the process of setting up a document. This wizard guides you through the stages involved in setting up an application.

After the setup is complete, you can copy your wizard to multiple qualifications, without having to re-create it again.  To do this, click [Duplicating Wizard](http://help.studentmanager.co.za/en/latest/Qualifications/DuplicatingWizard/)

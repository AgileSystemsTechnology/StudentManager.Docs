# **Creating Intakes**
An intake allows you to specify when a student can apply for the qualification, when applications close, and when they will commence studying in the qualification. A student is linked to a specific intake for a qualification.
You can create your intakes by doing the following: 

- Select Qualifications from the Main Menu Bar 
- Select Intakes
- Set up a date range for your intake. e.g. for a 2017 intake, your applications 
  process will precede the enrolment date. Oct - Dec 2016 (Applications) with Students starting on the 15 January, (Enrolment date)
- Once you’ve created an intake, you must specify which module groups are 
   a part of the intake
- To make it easy for you, you can set up your module groups by either using the “Add using curriculum” as a guide or “Add” your modules individually

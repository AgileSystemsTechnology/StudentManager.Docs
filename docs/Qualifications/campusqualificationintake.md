## **Campus Qualification Intake**

This feature enables the following:

1. Allows learners to select the qualification they are interested in during the application process
2. Allows for the course work page to be built up per learner with level grouping
3. Determines which modules will display correctly for the learner when their transcript is published
4. Ensures that the "Registration Wizard" has rules to reference for registration of modules  

**Tip!** Before the qualification option can be viewed by the learner, the qualification intake must be set up. You can do this by:

-	Selecting Qualifications from the Main Menu bar:
![alt text](Paste URL here URL here "Selecting Qualifications")

-	Select the relevant view in line with the relevant qualification:
![alt text](Paste URL here URL here "Selecting a single qualification")

-	Select the "Intakes and Curriculum" tab:
![alt text](Paste URL here URL here "Selecting qualification")

-	Select the campus for the particular intake
-	Click on the Add link on the right-hand-side
-	Add a description e.g. 2017 intake
-	Add your open and closing dates for the intake

**Tip!** Your open and closing date range should precede the intake period. E.g., you would set your open date for 1 October 2016 and closing date for the 30 November 2016 for the 2017 intake period. 

**Caution!** If the intake is used as a Lead Qualification interest or a Qualification that the applicant is applying for, you cannot delete it. 
Once you have set up your intake date range, you can add an applicant. Please see, Adding an Applicant.

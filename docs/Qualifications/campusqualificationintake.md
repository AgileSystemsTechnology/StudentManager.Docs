## **Campus Qualification Intake**

This feature allows students to select the qualification they are interested in during the application phase. 

**Tip!** Before the qualification option can be viewed by the student, the qualification intake must be set up. You can do this by:

-	Selecting Qualifications from the Main Menu bar
-	Select the relevant qualification and View
-	Select Intake 
-	Select the campus for the particular intake
-	Click on the Add link on the right-hand-side
-	Add a description e.g. 2017 intake
-	Add your open and closing dates for the intake

**Tip!** Your open and closing date range should precede the intake period. E.g., you would set your open date for 1 October 2016 and closing date for the 30 November 2016 for the 2017 intake period. 

**Caution!** If the intake is used as a Lead Qualification interest or a Qualification that the applicant is applying for, you cannot delete it. 
Once you have set up your intake date range, you can add an applicant. Please see, Adding an Applicant.

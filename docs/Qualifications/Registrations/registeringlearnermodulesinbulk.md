## **Bulk registration of modules**

- This feature allows for registration of modules in bulk within a given intake
 - The reason for this is to ensure that all the student following the same curriculum are registered in bulk following the same logic and curriculum rules, if you change the curriculum associated with an intake, you can potentially change the progression rules for a student
- The system will check all the curriculum rules requirements including:
 - Pre-requisites
 - Co-requisites
 - Number of modules which should be passed to continue to the next level
 
_*Please Note that this feature uses the qualifications registration dates, "group scope dates" settings, to know which groups to display*_

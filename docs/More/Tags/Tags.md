# **Tags**

## **Understanding Tags**

Tags can be used in different scenarios and are custom to your needs.  They can be used in defferent subcategories, for example: for a student, a staff member, a module, etc. (more about this below)
Just like we use tags on different things with different meanings, so can you use tags in Student Manager.

Example of Tags are: "Paid Fees", "Bursary student", etc.

### **Creating a Tag**

- Navigate to **Tags** by clicking on the **More** tab from the main menu
- Select your Category:
  - Student, Staff, Event, Ticket, Module, Module Group, Lead and Application
- After the category has been selected, click on **Add**
- Give the tag a **Name**
- Add a **Description** for the tagg
- Colour code your tagg
- Click on **Save** to commit the changes

After you have saved your tagg, you can **Delete** or **Edit** it to change the details or mark is as **inactive** by removing the tick next to **"Is active"**

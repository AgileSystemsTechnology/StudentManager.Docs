## **Role Groups**

Each staff member can be assigned rules.  These rules allow or deny certain functions within the system.  You can create groups for these rules and add certain staff to these groups.  For example: Administrators, Lecturers, etc.

To edit these roles:

- Click on **More** from the main menu and then **Settings**
- Scroll down to **Role Groups** on the left menu
- Click on **Add**
- Give your group a _**name**_ and a _**description**_
- Click on **Save**

You will now be presented with a new window.  
Here you can tick on each box under each section to allow roles to the group.  

_*Hint: use the **"toggle all"** to select or de-select all boxes under each section_

- Click on **Save** one last time to save the roles for this specific group. 

Note: You have now setup the role groups - but you still need to assign users to the group.  To do this, follow this link: [Employee System Access](http://help.studentmanager.co.za/en/latest/People/employeesystemaccess/#employee-system-access)

## **Names and labels in Student Manager(SM)**

### **What is the significance of naming or labelling**
- Naming is required for identification and differentiation 
	- This means that a name or label will give guidance to yourself or anyone at your institution, remember when naming that you may not be the last or only person to use the system so using simple naming conventions makes it easier to keep track and spot errors, having a discernable pattern will make it easier to understand, this will be explained later
	- If labelling or naming is a means of identification, we can only identify things in the system if there are distinct differences, for example, a Module called "World History 1" with the code "WH1" is quite similar to a module called "World History I" with the code "WH 1". If you were to ask someone to enrol/register students into the World History One course with the code WH1, they would find it difficult to distinguish between the two, which can have a ripple effect, leading to time loss and frustration

### **Labelling and Character spaces**
- When creating labels it's helpful to remember that a space is a character
- To serve as an example, if I was sending a message using a short message service (SMS) aka text message a space would use up a character on our character count for the message
	- as a further illustration the space will be represented by an underscore "_"
		- Student_Manager has 15 Characters, but only 14 letters
		- If a student's first name is George and I capture it as _George visually they look the same but the system recognises the space as its own character, making George and _George two different names
- Please bear this in mind when generating reports, capturing users or importing students, staff, modules, groups and qualifications, that a space in a name or label can change the way the system identifies results
